4) leghist_nagg.dta
This dataset contains our research team's coding of states' legislative histories with respect to RttT policies (spelled out in the document "RttT policies" in Additional Information folder). This dataset contains one observation per state/year/policy that was coded; it is thus disaggregated (our team coded multiple policies per application section), as opposed to leghist_agg (below), which aggregates the same data up to the RttT application section. 

Variables: 
statename: state
year: year
outcome: policy (RttT application section or control policy)
Y: 1 if given policy is on the books in given state/year, 0 otherwise 
lagY: 1-year lag of Y

lose_p1: dummy - state applied and lost in round 1
lose_p2: dummy - state applied and lost in round 2
lose: dummy - state applied in any round but never won

6) an1, an2, an3
These datasets were used in our three matching analyses, and are all based on the dataset leghist_agg. The first, an1, is the subset of observations from 2010 and 2011, when Phase 1 and 2 winners had been announced but Phase 3 winners had not. The second, an2, includes observations on Phase 1 and 2 winners in the third (2012), fourth (2013), and fifth (2014) years of their granting periods and Phase 3 winners in the first (2012), second (2013), and third (2014) years of their granting period, respectively. The third, an3, includes Phase 3 winners and Phase 1 and 2 losers that were not subsequently invited to participate in the third competition, observed over the years 2012 to 2014.

Variables are the same as in leghist_agg; variables beginning with "pctscore" are the score received by the state on its last submitted application as a percent of possible points on that section.
